"# vite-typescript-optionslist" 

This is a follow-along project from web development, simplified to help me better understand the workflow in a React project made with typescript.


It is also my first exposure to using vite instead of create-react-app, and wow is it way snappier in comparison. I don't think I'll be going back without good reason.


Finally, it accidentally introduced me to CSS modules, which I had seen around but never really understood. It seems like a great way to stay organized and avoid unwanted overlap of CSS classnames.
